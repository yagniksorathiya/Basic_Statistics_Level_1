      a) Equal to 1
        
      b) Less than or equal to 4

### Q5) A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?

### Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)

            CHILD	  Candies count	Probability
                  
             A	     1	           0.015
             B	     4	           0.20
             C	     3	           0.65
             D	     5	           0.005
             E	     6	           0.01
             F	     2	           0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.

Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20

### Q11) Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?

### Q12) Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56

    1) Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.

    2) What can we say about the student marks? 

### Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean and median of data are equal?

### Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?

### Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?

### Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?

### Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?

### Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.
 
+ What can we say about the distribution of the data?

+ What is nature of skewness of the data?

        MPG <- Cars $ MPG

    a. P(MPG>38)

    b. P(MPG<40)

    c. P(20<MPG<50)

###  Q24)   A Government company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
    Hint:  
          rcode   pt(tscore,df)  
          df  degrees of freedom
